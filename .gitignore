# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.

# Adding the following files to your `.gitignore` is crucial for maintaining the security and
# integrity of your project. These files likely contain sensitive information such as API keys,
# database URLs, and authentication tokens, which should not be exposed in your version control
# system. If these credentials are inadvertently committed to a public repository, they could be
# accessed by unauthorized users, leading to potential security breaches, unauthorized access to
# your services, and misuse of your accounts. By including these files in your `.gitignore`, you
# ensure that they remain local to your development environment, reducing the risk of accidental
# exposure and helping to maintain the confidentiality and security of your project.

# Adding `ngrok.exe` to your `.gitignore` file is a good practice for several reasons. First,
# `ngrok.exe` is a binary executable file that can be quite large, which can unnecessarily bloat
# your repository and slow down operations like cloning and fetching. Second, including executables
# in your repository can pose security risks, as they could potentially be replaced with malicious
# versions. Third, `ngrok.exe` is a third-party tool that is not essential to the source code of
# your project; it can be easily downloaded and installed separately by each developer as needed.
# By ignoring this file, you keep your repository clean, reduce its size, and avoid potential
# security issues, while ensuring that only the essential code and resources are tracked.
